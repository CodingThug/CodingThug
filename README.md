👋 Hi, I’m @CodingThug
👀 I’m passionate about Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and the world of web applications. But that’s not all—I’m diving deep into Solidity and Web3 to build decentralized applications (dApps) and explore blockchain technology.

🌱 I’m currently relearning the fundamentals of JavaScript, diving into advanced topics in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and mastering Solidity for building on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.

💻 My primary focus is on building decentralized apps (dApps) in the Web3 space. I’m working on a SocialFi dApp, creating a decentralized ecosystem with its own token system, focusing on staking, rewards, and community engagement.

💞️ I’m not looking for collaboration on open-source projects, but I’m always happy to discuss ideas or learn from others!

📫 If you’d like to get in touch, you can email me at codingthuglocalhost@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m not funny, but I enjoy building cool things!
