- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodingThug
- 👀 I’m interested in Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. I, of course love the world of web applications as well. That's why I'm here!
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning most of the basics I learned a few months ago; basic and advanced JavaScript, advanced Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any opensource projects, as that's not my goal.
- 📫 If you'd like to get in touch with me, which I doubt, you can send me an email ad codingthuglocalhost@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a boy Damon!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not funny.
